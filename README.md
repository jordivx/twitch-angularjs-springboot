"# twitch-angularjs-springboot" 

To run the application you need to run:

mvn spring-boot:run


You need to define the client id and secret in the application.properties in order to communicate with the Twitch API (Ctrl+F for CHANGEME).

To see it in action you have a video in this project root folder under the name "demo-video.mp4".

Because of the time, the pagination has not been implemented and some features have only been implemented in a basic manner.
